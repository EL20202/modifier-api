# modifier-api
A CC Mod Developer API that makes adding custom modifiers a bit easier. This mod was initially created to help multiple mods implementing custom damage modifiers to not override each other's code.

Currently, this mod handles:
* the visual representation of custom modifiers
* the application of damage modifiers (in `sc.CombatParams`)

More documentation to be added in the future.

More features to be added according to developer need.
